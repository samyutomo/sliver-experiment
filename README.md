# Experiencing Sliver Flutter
Project to build Scrolling UI using Sliver on Flutter framework

## What is Sliver?  
A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area, which means anything that scrolls in Flutter is a sliver.
In this project, you will learn how to efficiently build scrolling widgets and use slivers directly, to create a rich scrolling experience for users.

This project uses DartPad Project from [Sliver Workshop](https://dartpad.dev/workshops.html?webserver=https://dartpad-workshops-io2021.web.app/getting_started_with_slivers) with some adjustments by **Fadil Adithama** from *Flutter Festival 2022*. Let's go! 

>This workshop is best for folks already familiar with building simple Flutter applications. If this is your first time using Flutter, then check out [Writing Your First Flutter App](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) to get started using Flutter.

>For help getting started with Flutter, view Flutter [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers all about Flutter references.
